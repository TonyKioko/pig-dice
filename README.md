## Description
The Pig Dice is a simple game where two players have a chance to roll a dice.Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". First player to reach the set winning score wins.

## Pig Dice Rules ##
+ Two  players will compete. The first player to reach the set win score or more is  the winner.

+ When it is your turn, you roll. If you get a one, the game is passed to the other player.
+ If you get anything else, you may decide to roll again or pass the pigs.

+ If you keep rolling again, you accumulate points to add to your session score but if you get a one, then all your points accumulated in that turn are nullified.
